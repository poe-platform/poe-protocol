# Poe Bot Protocol

_Note: The Poe Protocol is not live yet. The protocol may still change and it is not yet
possible to create protocol-based bots._

[Poe](https://poe.com) is a platform for interacting with AI-based bots. That includes
well-known chat bots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, but anyone can create
their own bot by implementing the protocol described in this repository.
